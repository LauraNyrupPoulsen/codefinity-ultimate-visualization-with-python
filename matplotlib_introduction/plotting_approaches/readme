# Matplotlib

## Matplotlib Layers & Core Objects

This chapter covers the three-layer architecture of Matplotlib and how to create basic figures.

### 1. Architecture Overview

1. **Backend layer**  
   Renders plots to screens or files.

2. **Artist layer**  
   - **Containers**:  
     - `Figure` – the overall canvas  
     - `Axes` – holds x- and y-axis, the area you plot into  
   - **Primitives**: lines, rectangles, circles, text, etc.

3. **Scripting layer** (`pyplot`)  
   User-friendly API tying backend + artist layers together.

### 2. Key Classes

- **Figure**  
  The top-level container for all plot elements.

- **Axes**  
  The drawing area; holds two axis objects and plotting methods.

### 3. Quick Start Example

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Figure and a single Axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot (empty by default)
ax.plot()

# Display
plt.show()

### 4. Notes

- fig is your canvas; ax is where you call plot methods.

- Always call plt.show() to render the figure to screen.

## Basic Plotting

This chapter introduces how to create your first plot with Matplotlib using two styles:

1. **Scripting (state-machine) approach**

- You import pyplot as plt.
- You call plt.plot(x, y, 'o') directly—Matplotlib handles figure/axes creation behind the scenes.
- You display the plot with plt.show().

2. **Object-oriented approach**

- You call fig, ax = plt.subplots() to explicitly create a Figure and Axes.
- You plot via ax.plot(x, y, 'o').
- You still finish with plt.show().


**Key points:**

- Always import with import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
- The order of arguments to plot() is important: x then y.
- Both approaches are equivalent under the hood; the scripting approach is simpler and will be used most in the course.
